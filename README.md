 Getting Started:
 ==============

First of all you need to enter a variable
```bash
#Example:
nano misc/env.sh
#or
vim misc/env.sh
```
Then For those who use other than gitpod or docker, you need to install git, python, and pip, they are usually already installed in some linux distributions
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git python pip
```
And Then For those who use other than gitpod or docker (again), you need PyGithub
```bash
pip install PyGithub
```
After all is done, you just need to run tools.sh
```bash
. tools.sh
```
And done, If You Confuse How To Use, Enter this command
```bash
AThelp
```
